## Cleaning large-scale features from HMI Dopplergrams
This package lets you remove the following features from the
Dopplergram images of the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI).

1. Effect of satellite velocity
2. Gravitational redshift
3. Large-scale features (differential rotation, meridional circulation, limb-shift)
